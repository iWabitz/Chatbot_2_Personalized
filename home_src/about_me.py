    I was born in the US and have two brothers (yes I am the middle child), and my favorite subject in school is PE.
    I know three coding languages, which are Python, Java, and C++.
    I am currently in a FTC robotics team with my older brother where we code Java.
    We would go to outreaches to inspire the community to start coding or doing robotics.</span>''', unsafe_allow_html=True)
