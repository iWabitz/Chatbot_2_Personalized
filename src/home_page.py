I was born in the US and have two brothers (yes I am the middle child), and my favorite subject in school is PE.
I know three coding languages, which are Python, Java, and C++.
I am currently in a FTC robotics team with my older brother where we code Java.
We would go to outreaches to inspire the community to start coding or doing robotics.
